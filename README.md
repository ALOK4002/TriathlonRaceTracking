# Triathlon Race Tracking: sample application from Frontend development with ASP.NET Core MVC, Angular and Bootstrap

In the last chapter of my [Frontend development with ASP.NET Core MVC, Angular and Bootstrap](http://amzn.to/2Fgxqaq) I refer to this repository for a more complete example of application using ASP.NET Core MVC, Angular and Bootstrap.

I'm still putting some final touches and I'll publish the code soon.
